The purpose of this project was for me to gain some exposure to the pandas library in python so that I might be able to use it in future projects and employment

Specifically, I focused on the data analyzing capabilities of the library. I imported a CSV from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset?select=rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv) that contained a number of the top rated movies released in recent years according to rotten tomato.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

The results that the program yield with each use depending on the users input. With each use, the user will learn what the top rated film from a particular year and genre is.

# Development Environment

I wrote the program in Python using the Visual Studio Code IDE. Within the program, I made use of the following libraries and modules
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. time
4. colorama
5. termcolor

# Useful Websites

* [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [Official Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

# Future Work

* Refactor the program so it works with a more expansive data set
* Add option to see either the top 1, 3, 5, or 10 movies that match the users search criteria
